# Principal Component Analysis of a Spring-Mass System
Principal Component Analysis is a tool that allows us to condense large datasets into an approximation
matrix with significantly fewer dimensions. This project covers the use of principal component analysis
on the typical spring mass system for a variety of scenarios in which we attempt to find the principal
components that describe the direction of our data with the most variance and project our data onto
these principal components.
